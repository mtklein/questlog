# Requests

The following questions have been resolved:
- Quest hierarchy: quests contain one list of steps rather than nested quests.
- Map services: explore free options like Google Maps or Mapbox; don't commit to a paid provider yet.
- Design assets: none available, rely on best judgement.
- Licensing: the repository uses the MIT License.

No outstanding questions at this time.
