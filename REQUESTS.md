# Requests for the Project Owner

- Clarify how detailed the quest hierarchy should be. Should quests support unlimited depth of sub-quests?
- Confirm whether we should integrate any specific map or location services (e.g., Google Maps, Mapbox).
- Confirm if we have existing design assets or wireframes to follow.
- Please provide any preferred licensing or attribution requirements for future code.
