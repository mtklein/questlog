# QuestLog

Open index.html in a modern browser to try it out.

QuestLog is a lightweight journal for real-world adventures. This repository hosts a proof-of-concept implemented as a single HTML file. The page stores quests locally and blends a quest list with an interactive map so you can explore with a sense of purpose directly in the browser.

## MVP Goals
- **Quest Journal**: Create quests, edit their steps and check them off. Quests persist locally in the browser using `localStorage`.
- **Interactive Map**: View quest locations on a map.
- **Navigation and Routing**: Quests can define routes and waypoints so you can follow them on the map.
- **User Customization**: Define major and minor locations to keep the map focused and meaningful.
- **Simple Navigation**: A bottom navigation bar lets you switch between the journal and the map.

## Future Features
- **Compass Integration**: Use features like iOS Dynamic Island for persistent guidance.
- **Meaningful Feedback**: Provide haptic vibrations and sounds when discovering important locations.
- **Onâ€‘Device AI**: Employ Core ML for personalized suggestions and natural language quest creation.
- **Optional Objectives**: Support optional or side quests to make journeys feel layered without adding competitive gamification.
- **Fog of War**: hide areas of the map the user has not yet physically visited.

## Philosophy
QuestLog borrows the vocabulary of RPGs without turning life into a game. The goal is to encourage daily adventure and progress in real life, not to chase points or achievements.
