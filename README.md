# QuestLog

Open `index.html` in a modern browser to try it out.

QuestLog is a lightweight journal for real-world adventures. This repository hosts a proof-of-concept implemented as a single HTML file. The page stores quests locally and blends a quest list with an interactive map so you can explore with a sense of purpose directly in the browser.

## MVP Goals
- **Quest Journal**: Create quests, add nested steps and edit them. All progress persists locally using `localStorage`.
- **Interactive Map**: View quest locations on a map with a simple fog of war effect.
- **Navigation and Routing**: Quests draw basic routes between their steps on the map.
- **User Customization**: Define major and minor locations to keep the map focused and meaningful.
- **Simple Navigation**: A bottom navigation bar lets you switch between the journal and the map.

## Future Features
- **Compass Integration**: Use features like iOS Dynamic Island for persistent guidance.
- **Meaningful Feedback**: Provide haptic vibrations and sounds when discovering important locations.
- **Onâ€‘Device AI**: Employ Core ML for personalized suggestions and natural language quest creation.
- **Optional Objectives**: Support optional or side quests to make journeys feel layered without adding competitive gamification.
- **Fog of War**: persistent exploration tracking that reveals visited areas over time.

## Philosophy
QuestLog borrows the vocabulary of RPGs without turning life into a game. The goal is to encourage daily adventure and progress in real life, not to chase points or achievements.
