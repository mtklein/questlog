# QuestLog

QuestLog is a mobile application inspired by role-playing games. It blends a journal of quests with an interactive map to help users explore the real world with a sense of adventure.

## MVP Goals
- **Quest Journal**: Track ongoing and completed quests in a concise format. Support main quests and sub-quests.
- **Interactive Map**: Display markers for significant locations such as shops, rest points, or user-defined points of interest. Markers link back to quests in the journal.
- **Navigation and Routing**: Allow quests to include routes and waypoints so users can follow them on the map.
- **User Customization**: Let users define major and minor locations to keep the map focused and meaningful.

## Future Features
- **Compass Integration**: Use features like iOS Dynamic Island or Android foreground services for persistent guidance.
- **Meaningful Feedback**: Provide haptic vibrations and sounds when discovering important locations.
- **Onâ€‘Device AI**: Employ Core ML on iOS and TensorFlow Lite on Android for personalized suggestions and natural language quest creation.
- **Optional Objectives**: Support optional or side quests to make journeys feel layered without adding competitive gamification.

## Tech Stack
QuestLog will be built with **Flutter** so the same codebase runs on both iOS and Android. The app will use on-device AI models and may integrate with online services such as OpenAI if needed.

## Philosophy
QuestLog borrows the vocabulary of RPGs without turning life into a game. The goal is to encourage daily adventure and progress in real life, not to chase points or achievements.
