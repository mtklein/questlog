# AGENTS Instructions

These guidelines apply to all work in this repository.

1. **Use Flutter when implementing the mobile app** so it can run on both iOS and Android.
2. **Run any available tests** with `flutter test` or other commands before committing if tests exist.
3. **Keep documentation concise**. Summaries should mention the RPG-inspired quest journal, interactive map, and on-device AI features.
4. **Follow the project philosophy**: avoid competitive gamification; focus on real-life adventures and meaningful progress.
5. **Update PLAN.md** whenever work is done or new tasks are planned.
