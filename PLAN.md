# Development Plan

This repository will implement **QuestLog** as a single HTML page using plain JavaScript and CSS. The goal is a lightweight demo that runs entirely in the browser with no external build step.

## TODO
- [ ] Persist visited areas for the fog of war overlay between sessions.
- [ ] Add haptic or audio feedback when discovering major locations.
- [ ] Seed the app with example quests around Taipei.

Completed tasks should be removed from this list as development progresses.
