# Development Plan

## Completed
- Added initial documentation files based on the project kickoff conversation.
- Clarified requirements: two-level quest hierarchy, free map providers, no design assets, MIT license.

## Next Steps
- Decide on overall app architecture using Flutter.
- Experiment with Google Maps and Mapbox for mapping without committing to either.
- Set up testing framework with Flutter and create initial tests.
- Implement basic quest model (Quest with Steps) and journal UI.
