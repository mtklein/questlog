# Development Plan

## Completed
- Added initial documentation files based on the project kickoff conversation.
- Clarified requirements: one-level quest hierarchy, free map providers, no design assets, MIT license.
- Created minimal Flutter project with basic quest journal UI and tests.


## Next Steps
- Integrate an interactive map using a free provider.
- Expand tests and refactor UI code as features grow.
- Explore on-device AI for quest suggestions.
