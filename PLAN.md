# Development Plan

This repository will implement **QuestLog** as a single HTML page using plain JavaScript and CSS. The goal is a lightweight demo that runs entirely in the browser with no external build step.

## TODO
- [ ] Implement editing and nested step support for quests.
- [ ] Draw simple routes to quest locations with polylines.
- [ ] Experiment with a basic "fog of war" overlay that clears as the user moves.

Completed tasks should be removed from this list as development progresses.
